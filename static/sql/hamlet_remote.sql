Our last king,\r\nWhose image even but now appear’d to us,\r\nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,\r\nThereto prick’d on by a most emulate pride,\r\nDared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet—\r\nFor so this side of our known world esteem’d him—\r\nDid slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal’d compact,\r\nWell ratified by law and heraldry,\r\nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\r\nWhich he stood seized of, to the conqueror:\r\nAgainst the which, a moiety competent\r\nWas gaged by our king; which had return’d\r\nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras,\r\nHad he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,\r\nAnd carriage of the article design’d,\r\nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,\r\nOf unimproved mettle hot and full,\r\nHath in the skirts of Norway here and there\r\nShark’d up a list of lawless resolutes,\r\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise\r\nThat hath a stomach in’t; which is no other—\r\nAs it doth well appear unto our state—\r\nBut to recover of us, by strong hand\r\nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\r\nSo by his father lost: and this, I take it,\r\nIs the main motive of our preparations,\r\nThe source of this our watch and the chief head\r\nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\r\n\r\nBERNARDO  \r\nI think it be no other but e’en so:\r\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure\r\nComes armed through our watch; so like the king\r\nThat was and is the question of these wars.\r\n\r\nHORATIO  \r\nA mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.\r\nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\r\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell,\r\nThe graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead\r\nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:\r\nAs stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,\r\nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\r\nUpon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands\r\nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:\r\nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events,\r\nAs harbingers preceding still the fates\r\nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\r\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated\r\nUnto our climatures and countrymen.—\r\nBut soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Re-enter Ghost</p></div>\r\n\r\nI’ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!\r\nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice,\r\nSpeak to me:\r\nIf there be any good thing to be done,\r\nThat may to thee do ease and grace to me,\r\nSpeak to me:\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Cock crows</p></div>\r\n\r\nIf thou art privy to thy country’s fate,\r\nWhich, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!\r\nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\r\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth,\r\nFor which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,\r\nSpeak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.\r\n\r\nMARCELLUS  \r\nShall I strike at it with my partisan?\r\n\r\nHORATIO  \r\nDo, if it will not stand.\r\n\r\nBERNARDO  \r\n’Tis here!\r\n\r\nHORATIO  \r\n’Tis here!\r\n\r\nMARCELLUS  \r\n’Tis gone!\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Exit Ghost</p></div>\r\n\r\nWe do it wrong, being so majestical,\r\nTo offer it the show of violence;\r\nFor it is, as the air, invulnerable,\r\nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\r\n\r\nBERNARDO  \r\nIt was about to speak, when the cock crew.\r\n\r\nHORATIO  \r\nAnd then it started like a guilty thing\r\nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard,\r\nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,\r\nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat\r\nAwake the god of day; and, at his warning,\r\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air,\r\nThe extravagant and erring spirit hies\r\nTo his confine: and of the truth herein\r\nThis present object made probation.\r\n\r\nMARCELLUS  \r\nIt faded on the crowing of the cock.\r\nSome say that ever ‘gainst that season comes\r\nWherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated,\r\nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long:\r\nAnd then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;\r\nThe nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,\r\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,\r\nSo hallow’d and so gracious is the time.\r\n\r\nHORATIO  \r\nSo have I heard and do in part believe it.\r\nBut, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,\r\nWalks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill:\r\nBreak we our watch up; and by my advice,\r\nLet us impart what we have seen to-night\r\nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,\r\nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.\r\nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\r\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty?\r\n\r\nMARCELLUS  \r\nLet’s do’t, I pray; and I this morning know\r\nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Exeunt</p></div>\r\n\r\n',NULL),(7,1,'2016-02-19 14:33:42','2016-02-29 16:39:48',NULL,'Scene 2',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'scene-2',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'SCENE II.

What it should be,\r\nMore than his father’s death, that thus hath put him\r\nSo much from the understanding of himself,\r\nI cannot dream of: I entreat you both,\r\nThat, being of so young days brought up with him,\r\nAnd sith so neighbour’d to his youth and havior,\r\nThat you vouchsafe your rest here in our court\r\nSome little time: so by your companies\r\nTo draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,\r\nSo much as from occasion you may glean,\r\nWhether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,\r\nThat, open’d, lies within our remedy.\r\n\r\nQUEEN GERTRUDE  \r\nGood gentlemen, he hath much talk’d of you;\r\nAnd sure I am two men there are not living\r\nTo whom he more adheres. If it will please you\r\nTo show us so much gentry and good will\r\nAs to expend your time with us awhile,\r\nFor the supply and profit of our hope,\r\nYour visitation shall receive such thanks\r\nAs fits a king’s remembrance.\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ  \r\nBoth your majesties\r\nMight, by the sovereign power you have of us,\r\nPut your dread pleasures more into command\r\nThan to entreaty.\r\n\r\nGUILDENSTERN  \r\nBut we both obey,\r\nAnd here give up ourselves, in the full bent\r\nTo lay our service freely at your feet,\r\nTo be commanded.\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nThanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.\r\n\r\nQUEEN GERTRUDE  \r\nThanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:\r\nAnd I beseech you instantly to visit\r\nMy too much changed son. Go, some of you,\r\nAnd bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.\r\n\r\nGUILDENSTERN  \r\nHeavens make our presence and our practises\r\nPleasant and helpful to him!\r\n\r\nQUEEN GERTRUDE  \r\nAy, amen!\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some Attendants</p></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Enter POLONIUS</p></div>\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\nThe ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,\r\nAre joyfully return’d.\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nThou still hast been the father of good news.\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\nHave I, my lord? I assure my good liege,\r\nI hold my duty, as I hold my soul,\r\nBoth to my God and to my gracious king:\r\nAnd I do think, or else this brain of mine\r\nHunts not the trail of policy so sure\r\nAs it hath used to do, that I have found\r\nThe very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy.\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nO, speak of that; that do I long to hear.\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\nGive first admittance to the ambassadors;\r\nMy news shall be the fruit to that great feast.\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nThyself do grace to them, and bring them in.\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Exit POLONIUS</p></div>\r\n\r\nHe tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found\r\nThe head and source of all your son’s distemper.\r\n\r\nQUEEN GERTRUDE  \r\nI doubt it is no other but the main;\r\nHis father’s death, and our o’erhasty marriage.\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nWell, we shall sift him.\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</p></div>\r\n\r\nWelcome, my good friends!\r\nSay, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?\r\n\r\nVOLTIMAND  \r\nMost fair return of greetings and desires.\r\nUpon our first, he sent out to suppress\r\nHis nephew’s levies; which to him appear’d\r\nTo be a preparation ‘gainst the Polack;\r\nBut, better look’d into, he truly found\r\nIt was against your highness: whereat grieved,\r\nThat so his sickness, age and impotence\r\nWas falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests\r\nOn Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;\r\nReceives rebuke from Norway, and in fine\r\nMakes vow before his uncle never more\r\nTo give the assay of arms against your majesty.\r\nWhereon old Norway, overcome with joy,\r\nGives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,\r\nAnd his commission to employ those soldiers,\r\nSo levied as before, against the Polack:\r\nWith an entreaty, herein further shown,\r\nGiving a paper\r\n\r\nThat it might please you to give quiet pass\r\nThrough your dominions for this enterprise,\r\nOn such regards of safety and allowance\r\nAs therein are set down.\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nIt likes us well;\r\nAnd at our more consider’d time well read,\r\nAnswer, and think upon this business.\r\nMeantime we thank you for your well-took labour:\r\nGo to your rest; at night we’ll feast together:\r\nMost welcome home!\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</p></div>\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\nThis business is well ended.\r\nMy liege, and madam, to expostulate\r\nWhat majesty should be, what duty is,\r\nWhy day is day, night night, and time is time,\r\nWere nothing but to waste night, day and time.\r\nTherefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,\r\nAnd tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,\r\nI will be brief: your noble son is mad:\r\nMad call I it; for, to define true madness,\r\nWhat is’t but to be nothing else but mad?\r\nBut let that go.\r\n\r\nQUEEN GERTRUDE  \r\nMore matter, with less art.\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\nMadam, I swear I use no art at all.\r\nThat he is mad, ’tis true: ’tis true ’tis pity;\r\nAnd pity ’tis ’tis true: a foolish figure;\r\nBut farewell it, for I will use no art.\r\nMad let us grant him, then: and now remains\r\nThat we find out the cause of this effect,\r\nOr rather say, the cause of this defect,\r\nFor this effect defective comes by cause:\r\nThus it remains, and the remainder thus.

But what might you think,\r\nWhen I had seen this hot love on the wing—\r\nAs I perceived it, I must tell you that,\r\nBefore my daughter told me—what might you,\r\nOr my dear majesty your queen here, think,\r\nIf I had play’d the desk or table-book,\r\nOr given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,\r\nOr look’d upon this love with idle sight;\r\nWhat might you think? No, I went round to work,\r\nAnd my young mistress thus I did bespeak:\r\n‘Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;\r\nThis must not be:’ and then I precepts gave her,\r\nThat she should lock herself from his resort,\r\nAdmit no messengers, receive no tokens.\r\nWhich done, she took the fruits of my advice;\r\nAnd he, repulsed—a short tale to make—\r\nFell into a sadness, then into a fast,\r\nThence to a watch, thence into a weakness,\r\nThence to a lightness, and, by this declension,\r\nInto the madness wherein now he raves,\r\nAnd all we mourn for.\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nDo you think ’tis this?\r\n\r\nQUEEN GERTRUDE  \r\nIt may be, very likely.\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\nHath there been such a time—I’d fain know that—\r\nThat I have positively said ’Tis so,’\r\nWhen it proved otherwise?\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nNot that I know.\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\n[Pointing to his head and shoulder]\r\nTake this from this, if this be otherwise:\r\nIf circumstances lead me, I will find\r\nWhere truth is hid, though it were hid indeed\r\nWithin the centre.\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nHow may we try it further?\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\nYou know, sometimes he walks four hours together\r\nHere in the lobby.\r\n\r\nQUEEN GERTRUDE  \r\nSo he does indeed.\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\nAt such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him:\r\nBe you and I behind an arras then;\r\nMark the encounter: if he love her not\r\nAnd be not from his reason fall’n thereon,\r\nLet me be no assistant for a state,\r\nBut keep a farm and carters.\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nWe will try it.\r\n\r\nQUEEN GERTRUDE  \r\nBut, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\nAway, I do beseech you, both away:\r\nI’ll board him presently.\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and Attendants</p></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Enter HAMLET, reading</p></div>\r\n\r\nO, give me leave:\r\nHow does my good Lord Hamlet?\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nWell, God-a-mercy.\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\nDo you know me, my lord?\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nExcellent well; you are a fishmonger.\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\nNot I, my lord.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nThen I would you were so honest a man.\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\nHonest, my lord!\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nAy, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be\r\none man picked out of ten thousand.\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\nThat’s very true, my lord.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nFor if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a\r\ngod kissing carrion,—Have you a daughter?\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\nI have, my lord.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nLet her not walk i’ the sun: conception is a\r\nblessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.\r\nFriend, look to ‘t.\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\n*Aside* How say you by that? Still harping on my\r\ndaughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I\r\nwas a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and\r\ntruly in my youth I suffered much extremity for\r\nlove; very near this. I’ll speak to him again.\r\nWhat do you read, my lord?\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nWords, words, words.\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\nWhat is the matter, my lord?\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nBetween who?\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\nI mean, the matter that you read, my lord.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nSlanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here\r\nthat old men have grey beards, that their faces are\r\nwrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and\r\nplum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of\r\nwit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,\r\nthough I most powerfully and potently believe, yet\r\nI hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for\r\nyourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab\r\nyou could go backward.\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\n*Aside* Though this be madness, yet there is method\r\nin ‘t. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nInto my grave.\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\nIndeed, that is out o’ the air.\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Aside</p></div>\r\n\r\nHow pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness\r\nthat often madness hits on, which reason and sanity\r\ncould not so prosperously be delivered of.

How dost thou,\r\nGuildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ  \r\nAs the indifferent children of the earth.\r\n\r\nGUILDENSTERN  \r\nHappy, in that we are not over-happy;\r\nOn fortune’s cap we are not the very button.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nNor the soles of her shoe?\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ  \r\nNeither, my lord.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nThen you live about her waist, or in the middle of\r\nher favours?\r\n\r\nGUILDENSTERN  \r\n‘Faith, her privates we.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nIn the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she\r\nis a strumpet. What’s the news?\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ  \r\nNone, my lord, but that the world’s grown honest.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nThen is doomsday near: but your news is not true.\r\nLet me question more in particular: what have you,\r\nmy good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,\r\nthat she sends you to prison hither?\r\n\r\nGUILDENSTERN  \r\nPrison, my lord!\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nDenmark’s a prison.\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ  \r\nThen is the world one.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nA goodly one; in which there are many confines,\r\nwards and dungeons, Denmark being one o’ the worst.\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ  \r\nWe think not so, my lord.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nWhy, then, ’tis none to you; for there is nothing\r\neither good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me\r\nit is a prison.\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ  \r\nWhy then, your ambition makes it one; ’tis too\r\nnarrow for your mind.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nO God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count\r\nmyself a king of infinite space, were it not that I\r\nhave bad dreams.\r\n\r\nGUILDENSTERN  \r\nWhich dreams indeed are ambition, for the very\r\nsubstance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nA dream itself is but a shadow.\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ  \r\nTruly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a\r\nquality that it is but a shadow’s shadow.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nThen are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and\r\noutstretched heroes the beggars’ shadows. Shall we\r\nto the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN  \r\nWe’ll wait upon you.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nNo such matter: I will not sort you with the rest\r\nof my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest\r\nman, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the\r\nbeaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ  \r\nTo visit you, my lord; no other occasion.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nBeggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I\r\nthank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are\r\ntoo dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it\r\nyour own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,\r\ndeal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.\r\n\r\nGUILDENSTERN  \r\nWhat should we say, my lord?\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nWhy, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent\r\nfor; and there is a kind of confession in your looks\r\nwhich your modesties have not craft enough to colour:\r\nI know the good king and queen have sent for you.\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ  \r\nTo what end, my lord?\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nThat you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by\r\nthe rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of\r\nour youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved\r\nlove, and by what more dear a better proposer could\r\ncharge you withal, be even and direct with me,\r\nwhether you were sent for, or no?\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ  \r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Aside to GUILDENSTERN</p></div>\r\n\r\nWhat say you?\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\n*Aside*Nay, then, I have an eye of you.—If you\r\nlove me, hold not off.\r\n\r\nGUILDENSTERN  \r\nMy lord, we were sent for.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nI will tell you why; so shall my anticipation\r\nprevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king\r\nand queen moult no feather. I have of late—but\r\nwherefore I know not—lost all my mirth, forgone all\r\ncustom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily\r\nwith my disposition that this goodly frame, the\r\nearth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most\r\nexcellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave\r\no’erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted\r\nwith golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to\r\nme than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.\r\nWhat a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!\r\nhow infinite in faculty! in form and moving how\r\nexpress and admirable! in action how like an angel!\r\nin apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the\r\nworld! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,\r\nwhat is this quintessence of dust? man delights not\r\nme: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling\r\nyou seem to say so.\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ  \r\nMy lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nWhy did you laugh then, when I said ‘man delights not me’?\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ  \r\nTo think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what\r\nlenten entertainment the players shall receive from\r\nyou: we coted them on the way; and hither are they\r\ncoming, to offer you service.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nHe that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty\r\nshall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight\r\nshall use his foil and target; the lover shall not\r\nsigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part\r\nin peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose\r\nlungs are tickled o’ the sere; and the lady shall\r\nsay her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt\r\nfor’t. What players are they?\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ  \r\nEven those you were wont to take delight in, the\r\ntragedians of the city.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nHow chances it they travel? their residence, both\r\nin reputation and profit, was better both ways.\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ  \r\nI think their inhibition comes by the means of the\r\nlate innovation.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nDo they hold the same estimation they did when I was\r\nin the city? are they so followed?\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ  \r\nNo, indeed, are they not.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nHow comes it? do they grow rusty?\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ  \r\nNay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but\r\nthere is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,\r\nthat cry out on the top of question, and are most\r\ntyrannically clapped for’t: these are now the\r\nfashion, and so berattle the common stages—so they\r\ncall them—that many wearing rapiers are afraid of\r\ngoose-quills and dare scarce come thither.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nWhat, are they children? who maintains ‘em? how are\r\nthey escoted? Will they pursue the quality no\r\nlonger than they can sing? will they not say\r\nafterwards, if they should grow themselves to common\r\nplayers—as it is most like, if their means are no\r\nbetter—their writers do them wrong, to make them\r\nexclaim against their own succession?\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ  \r\n‘Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and\r\nthe nation holds it no sin to tarre them to\r\ncontroversy: there was, for a while, no money bid\r\nfor argument, unless the poet and the player went to\r\ncuffs in the question.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nIs’t possible?\r\n\r\nGUILDENSTERN  \r\nO, there has been much throwing about of brains.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nDo the boys carry it away?\r\n\r\nROSENCRANTZ  \r\nAy, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nIt is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of\r\nDenmark, and those that would make mows at him while\r\nmy father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an\r\nhundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.\r\n‘Sblood, there is something in this more than\r\nnatural, if philosophy could find it out.\r\n++\r\n<div class=stage><p>Flourish of trumpets within</p></div>\r\n\r\nGUILDENSTERN  \r\nThere are the players.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nGentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.

I remember, one said there\r\nwere no sallets in the lines to make the matter\r\nsavoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might\r\nindict the author of affectation; but called it an\r\nhonest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very\r\nmuch more handsome than fine. One speech in it I\r\nchiefly loved: ‘twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido; and\r\nthereabout of it especially, where he speaks of\r\nPriam’s slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin\r\nat this line: let me see, let me see—\r\n‘The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,’—\r\nit is not so:—it begins with Pyrrhus:—\r\n‘The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,\r\nBlack as his purpose, did the night resemble\r\nWhen he lay couched in the ominous horse,\r\nHath now this dread and black complexion smear’d\r\nWith heraldry more dismal; head to foot\r\nNow is he total gules; horridly trick’d\r\nWith blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,\r\nBaked and impasted with the parching streets,\r\nThat lend a tyrannous and damned light\r\nTo their lord’s murder: roasted in wrath and fire,\r\nAnd thus o’er-sized with coagulate gore,\r\nWith eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\r\nOld grandsire Priam seeks.’\r\nSo, proceed you.\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\n‘Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and\r\ngood discretion.\r\n\r\nFirst Player  \r\n‘Anon he finds him\r\nStriking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,\r\nRebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,\r\nRepugnant to command: unequal match’d,\r\nPyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;\r\nBut with the whiff and wind of his fell sword\r\nThe unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,\r\nSeeming to feel this blow, with flaming top\r\nStoops to his base, and with a hideous crash\r\nTakes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear: for, lo! his sword,\r\nWhich was declining on the milky head\r\nOf reverend Priam, seem’d i’ the air to stick:\r\nSo, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,\r\nAnd like a neutral to his will and matter,\r\nDid nothing.\r\nBut, as we often see, against some storm,\r\nA silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,\r\nThe bold winds speechless and the orb below\r\nAs hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder\r\nDoth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus’ pause,\r\nAroused vengeance sets him new a-work;\r\nAnd never did the Cyclops’ hammers fall\r\nOn Mars’s armour forged for proof eterne\r\nWith less remorse than Pyrrhus’ bleeding sword\r\nNow falls on Priam.\r\nOut, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,\r\nIn general synod ‘take away her power;\r\nBreak all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,\r\nAnd bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,\r\nAs low as to the fiends!’\r\n\r\nLORD POLONIUS  \r\nThis is too long.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nIt shall to the barber’s, with your beard.

What would he do,\r\nHad he the motive and the cue for passion\r\nThat I have? He would drown the stage with tears\r\nAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech,\r\nMake mad the guilty and appal the free,\r\nConfound the ignorant, and amaze indeed\r\nThe very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,\r\nA dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,\r\nLike John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,\r\nAnd can say nothing; no, not for a king,\r\nUpon whose property and most dear life\r\nA damn’d defeat was made. Am I a coward?\r\nWho calls me villain? breaks my pate across?\r\nPlucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?\r\nTweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i’ the throat,\r\nAs deep as to the lungs? who does me this?\r\nHa!\r\n‘Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be\r\nBut I am pigeon-liver’d and lack gall\r\nTo make oppression bitter, or ere this\r\nI should have fatted all the region kites\r\nWith this slave’s offal: bloody, bawdy villain!\r\nRemorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!\r\nO, vengeance!\r\nWhy, what an ass am I!

I’ll have these players\r\nPlay something like the murder of my father\r\nBefore mine uncle: I’ll observe his looks;\r\nI’ll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,\r\nI know my course. The spirit that I have seen\r\nMay be the devil: and the devil hath power\r\nTo assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps\r\nOut of my weakness and my melancholy,\r\nAs he is very potent with such spirits,\r\nAbuses me to damn me: I’ll have grounds\r\nMore relative than this: the play ‘s the thing\r\nWherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Exit</p></div>\r\n\r\n',NULL),(13,1,'2016-02-19 14:34:38','2016-02-29 16:40:55',NULL,'Scene 1',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'scene-1',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'SCENE I.

But let him come;\r\nIt warms the very sickness in my heart,\r\nThat I shall live and tell him to his teeth,\r\n‘Thus didest thou.’\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nIf it be so, Laertes—\r\nAs how should it be so? how otherwise?—\r\nWill you be ruled by me?\r\n\r\nLAERTES  \r\nAy, my lord;\r\nSo you will not o’errule me to a peace.\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nTo thine own peace. If he be now return’d,\r\nAs checking at his voyage, and that he means\r\nNo more to undertake it, I will work him\r\nTo an exploit, now ripe in my device,\r\nUnder the which he shall not choose but fall:\r\nAnd for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,\r\nBut even his mother shall uncharge the practise\r\nAnd call it accident.\r\n\r\nLAERTES  \r\nMy lord, I will be ruled;\r\nThe rather, if you could devise it so\r\nThat I might be the organ.\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nIt falls right.\r\nYou have been talk’d of since your travel much,\r\nAnd that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality\r\nWherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts\r\nDid not together pluck such envy from him\r\nAs did that one, and that, in my regard,\r\nOf the unworthiest siege.\r\n\r\nLAERTES  \r\nWhat part is that, my lord?\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nA very riband in the cap of youth,\r\nYet needful too; for youth no less becomes\r\nThe light and careless livery that it wears\r\nThan settled age his sables and his weeds,\r\nImporting health and graveness. Two months since,\r\nHere was a gentleman of Normandy:—\r\nI’ve seen myself, and served against, the French,\r\nAnd they can well on horseback: but this gallant\r\nHad witchcraft in’t; he grew unto his seat;\r\nAnd to such wondrous doing brought his horse,\r\nAs he had been incorpsed and demi-natured\r\nWith the brave beast: so far he topp’d my thought,\r\nThat I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,\r\nCome short of what he did.\r\n\r\nLAERTES  \r\nA Norman was’t?\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nA Norman.\r\n\r\nLAERTES  \r\nUpon my life, Lamond.\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nThe very same.\r\n\r\nLAERTES  \r\nI know him well: he is the brooch indeed\r\nAnd gem of all the nation.\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nHe made confession of you,\r\nAnd gave you such a masterly report\r\nFor art and exercise in your defence\r\nAnd for your rapier most especially,\r\nThat he cried out, ‘twould be a sight indeed,\r\nIf one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,\r\nHe swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,\r\nIf you opposed them. Sir, this report of his\r\nDid Hamlet so envenom with his envy\r\nThat he could nothing do but wish and beg\r\nYour sudden coming o’er, to play with him.\r\nNow, out of this,—\r\n\r\nLAERTES  \r\nWhat out of this, my lord?\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nLaertes, was your father dear to you?\r\nOr are you like the painting of a sorrow,\r\nA face without a heart?\r\n\r\nLAERTES  \r\nWhy ask you this?\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nNot that I think you did not love your father;\r\nBut that I know love is begun by time;\r\nAnd that I see, in passages of proof,\r\nTime qualifies the spark and fire of it.\r\nThere lives within the very flame of love\r\nA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;\r\nAnd nothing is at a like goodness still;\r\nFor goodness, growing to a plurisy,\r\nDies in his own too much: that we would do\r\nWe should do when we would; for this ‘would’ changes\r\nAnd hath abatements and delays as many\r\nAs there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;\r\nAnd then this ‘should’ is like a spendthrift sigh,\r\nThat hurts by easing. But, to the quick o’ the ulcer:—\r\nHamlet comes back: what would you undertake,\r\nTo show yourself your father’s son in deed\r\nMore than in words?\r\n\r\nLAERTES  \r\nTo cut his throat i’ the church.\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nNo place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;\r\nRevenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,\r\nWill you do this, keep close within your chamber.\r\nHamlet return’d shall know you are come home:\r\nWe’ll put on those shall praise your excellence\r\nAnd set a double varnish on the fame\r\nThe Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together\r\nAnd wager on your heads: he, being remiss,\r\nMost generous and free from all contriving,\r\nWill not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,\r\nOr with a little shuffling, you may choose\r\nA sword unbated, and in a pass of practise\r\nRequite him for your father.\r\n\r\nLAERTES  \r\nI will do’t:\r\nAnd, for that purpose, I’ll anoint my sword.\r\nI bought an unction of a mountebank,\r\nSo mortal that, but dip a knife in it,\r\nWhere it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,\r\nCollected from all simples that have virtue\r\nUnder the moon, can save the thing from death\r\nThat is but scratch’d withal: I’ll touch my point\r\nWith this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,\r\nIt may be death.\r\n\r\nKING CLAUDIUS  \r\nLet’s further think of this;\r\nWeigh what convenience both of time and means\r\nMay fit us to our shape: if this should fail,\r\nAnd that our drift look through our bad performance,\r\n‘Twere better not assay’d: therefore this project\r\nShould have a back or second, that might hold,\r\nIf this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:\r\nWe’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha’t.\r\nWhen in your motion you are hot and dry—\r\nAs make your bouts more violent to that end—\r\nAnd that he calls for drink, I’ll have prepared him\r\nA chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,\r\nIf he by chance escape your venom’d stuck,\r\nOur purpose may hold there.\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE</p></div>\r\n\r\nHow now, sweet queen!\r\n++\r\nQUEEN GERTRUDE  \r\nOne woe doth tread upon another’s heel,\r\nSo fast they follow; your sister’s drown’d, Laertes.\r\n\r\nLAERTES  \r\nDrown’d! O, where?\r\n\r\nQUEEN GERTRUDE  \r\nThere is a willow grows aslant a brook,\r\nThat shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;\r\nThere with fantastic garlands did she come\r\nOf crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples\r\nThat liberal shepherds give a grosser name,\r\nBut our cold maids do dead men’s fingers call them:\r\nThere, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds\r\nClambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;\r\nWhen down her weedy trophies and herself\r\nFell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;\r\nAnd, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:\r\nWhich time she chanted snatches of old tunes;\r\nAs one incapable of her own distress,\r\nOr like a creature native and indued\r\nUnto that element: but long it could not be\r\nTill that her garments, heavy with their drink,\r\nPull’d the poor wretch from her melodious lay\r\nTo muddy death.\r\n\r\nLAERTES  \r\nAlas, then, she is drown’d?\r\n\r\nQUEEN GERTRUDE  \r\nDrown’d, drown’d.\r\n\r\nLAERTES  \r\nToo much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,\r\nAnd therefore I forbid my tears: but yet\r\nIt is our trick; nature her custom holds,\r\nLet shame say what it will: when these are gone,\r\nThe woman will be out.

For\r\nhere lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly,\r\nit argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it\r\nis, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned\r\nherself wittingly.\r\n\r\nSecond Clown  \r\nNay, but hear you, goodman delver,—\r\n\r\nFirst Clown  \r\nGive me leave. Here lies the water; good: here\r\nstands the man; good; if the man go to this water,\r\nand drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he\r\ngoes,—mark you that; but if the water come to him\r\nand drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he\r\nthat is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.\r\n\r\nSecond Clown  \r\nBut is this law?\r\n\r\nFirst Clown  \r\nAy, marry, is’t; crowner’s quest law.\r\n\r\nSecond Clown  \r\nWill you ha’ the truth on’t? If this had not been\r\na gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o’\r\nChristian burial.\r\n\r\nFirst Clown  \r\nWhy, there thou say’st: and the more pity that\r\ngreat folk should have countenance in this world to\r\ndrown or hang themselves, more than their even\r\nChristian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient\r\ngentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:\r\nthey hold up Adam’s profession.\r\n\r\nSecond Clown  \r\nWas he a gentleman?\r\n\r\nFirst Clown  \r\nHe was the first that ever bore arms.\r\n\r\nSecond Clown  \r\nWhy, he had none.\r\n\r\nFirst Clown  \r\nWhat, art a heathen?

But, in the\r\nverity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of\r\ngreat article; and his infusion of such dearth and\r\nrareness, as, to make true diction of him, his\r\nsemblable is his mirror; and who else would trace\r\nhim, his umbrage, nothing more.\r\n\r\nOSRIC  \r\nYour lordship speaks most infallibly of him.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nThe concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman\r\nin our more rawer breath?\r\n\r\nOSRIC  \r\nSir?\r\n\r\nHORATIO  \r\nIs’t not possible to understand in another tongue?\r\nYou will do’t, sir, really.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nWhat imports the nomination of this gentleman?\r\n\r\nOSRIC  \r\nOf Laertes?\r\n\r\nHORATIO  \r\nHis purse is empty already; all’s golden words are spent.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nOf him, sir.\r\n\r\nOSRIC  \r\nI know you are not ignorant—\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nI would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,\r\nit would not much approve me. Well, sir?\r\n\r\nOSRIC  \r\nYou are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is—\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nI dare not confess that, lest I should compare with\r\nhim in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to\r\nknow himself.\r\n\r\nOSRIC  \r\nI mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation\r\nlaid on him by them, in his meed he’s unfellowed.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nWhat’s his weapon?\r\n\r\nOSRIC  \r\nRapier and dagger.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nThat’s two of his weapons: but, well.\r\n\r\nOSRIC  \r\nThe king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary\r\nhorses: against the which he has imponed, as I take\r\nit, six French rapiers and poniards, with their\r\nassigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the\r\ncarriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very\r\nresponsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,\r\nand of very liberal conceit.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nWhat call you the carriages?\r\n\r\nHORATIO  \r\nI knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.\r\n\r\nOSRIC  \r\nThe carriages, sir, are the hangers.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nThe phrase would be more german to the matter, if we\r\ncould carry cannon by our sides: I would it might\r\nbe hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses\r\nagainst six French swords, their assigns, and three\r\nliberal-conceited carriages; that’s the French bet\r\nagainst the Danish. Why is this ‘imponed,’ as you call it?\r\n\r\nOSRIC  \r\nThe king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes\r\nbetween yourself and him, he shall not exceed you\r\nthree hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it\r\nwould come to immediate trial, if your lordship\r\nwould vouchsafe the answer.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nHow if I answer ‘no’?\r\n\r\nOSRIC  \r\nI mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nSir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his\r\nmajesty, ’tis the breathing time of day with me; let\r\nthe foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the\r\nking hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;\r\nif not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.\r\n\r\nOSRIC  \r\nShall I re-deliver you e’en so?\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nTo this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.\r\n\r\nOSRIC  \r\nI commend my duty to your lordship.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nYours, yours.\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Exit OSRIC</p></div>\r\n\r\nHe does well to commend it himself; there are no\r\ntongues else for’s turn.\r\n\r\nHORATIO  \r\nThis lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nHe did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.\r\nThus has he—and many more of the same bevy that I\r\nknow the dressy age dotes on—only got the tune of\r\nthe time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of\r\nyesty collection, which carries them through and\r\nthrough the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do\r\nbut blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Enter a Lord</p></div>\r\n\r\nLord  \r\nMy lord, his majesty commended him to you by young\r\nOsric, who brings back to him that you attend him in\r\nthe hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to\r\nplay with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nI am constant to my purpose; they follow the king’s\r\npleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now\r\nor whensoever, provided I be so able as now.\r\n\r\nLord  \r\nThe king and queen and all are coming down.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nIn happy time.\r\n\r\nLord  \r\nThe queen desires you to use some gentle\r\nentertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nShe well instructs me.\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Exit Lord</p></div>\r\n\r\nHORATIO  \r\nYou will lose this wager, my lord.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nI do not think so: since he went into France, I\r\nhave been in continual practise: I shall win at the\r\nodds.

Horatio, I am dead;\r\nThou livest; report me and my cause aright\r\nTo the unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nHORATIO  \r\nNever believe it:\r\nI am more an antique Roman than a Dane:\r\nHere’s yet some liquor left.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nAs thou’rt a man,\r\nGive me the cup: let go; by heaven, I’ll have’t.\r\nO good Horatio, what a wounded name,\r\nThings standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!\r\nIf thou didst ever hold me in thy heart\r\nAbsent thee from felicity awhile,\r\nAnd in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,\r\nTo tell my story.\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>March afar off, and shot within</p></div>\r\n\r\nWhat warlike noise is this?\r\n\r\nOSRIC  \r\nYoung Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,\r\nTo the ambassadors of England gives\r\nThis warlike volley.\r\n\r\nHAMLET  \r\nO, I die, Horatio;\r\nThe potent poison quite o’er-crows my spirit:\r\nI cannot live to hear the news from England;\r\nBut I do prophesy the election lights\r\nOn Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;\r\nSo tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,\r\nWhich have solicited. The rest is silence.\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Dies</p></div>\r\n\r\nHORATIO  \r\nNow cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:\r\nAnd flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!\r\nWhy does the drum come hither?\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>March within</p></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors, and others</p></div>\r\n\r\nPRINCE FORTINBRAS  \r\nWhere is this sight?\r\n\r\nHORATIO  \r\nWhat is it ye would see?\r\nIf aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.\r\n\r\nPRINCE FORTINBRAS  \r\nThis quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,\r\nWhat feast is toward in thine eternal cell,\r\nThat thou so many princes at a shot\r\nSo bloodily hast struck?\r\n\r\nFirst Ambassador  \r\nThe sight is dismal;\r\nAnd our affairs from England come too late:\r\nThe ears are senseless that should give us hearing,\r\nTo tell him his commandment is fulfill’d,\r\nThat Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:\r\nWhere should we have our thanks?\r\n\r\nHORATIO  \r\nNot from his mouth,\r\nHad it the ability of life to thank you:\r\nHe never gave commandment for their death.\r\nBut since, so jump upon this bloody question,\r\nYou from the Polack wars, and you from England,\r\nAre here arrived give order that these bodies\r\nHigh on a stage be placed to the view;\r\nAnd let me speak to the yet unknowing world\r\nHow these things came about: so shall you hear\r\nOf carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,\r\nOf accidental judgments, casual slaughters,\r\nOf deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,\r\nAnd, in this upshot, purposes mistook\r\nFall’n on the inventors’ reads: all this can I\r\nTruly deliver.\r\n\r\nPRINCE FORTINBRAS  \r\nLet us haste to hear it,\r\nAnd call the noblest to the audience.\r\nFor me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:\r\nI have some rights of memory in this kingdom,\r\nWhich now to claim my vantage doth invite me.\r\n\r\nHORATIO  \r\nOf that I shall have also cause to speak,\r\nAnd from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;\r\nBut let this same be presently perform’d,\r\nEven while men’s minds are wild; lest more mischance\r\nOn plots and errors, happen.\r\n\r\nPRINCE FORTINBRAS  \r\nLet four captains\r\nBear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;\r\nFor he was likely, had he been put on,\r\nTo have proved most royally: and, for his passage,\r\nThe soldiers’ music and the rites of war\r\nSpeak loudly for him.\r\nTake up the bodies: such a sight as this\r\nBecomes the field, but here shows much amiss.\r\nGo, bid the soldiers shoot.\r\n\r\n<div class=stage><p>A dead march.
